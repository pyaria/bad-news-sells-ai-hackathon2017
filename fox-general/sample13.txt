A Texas Trump supporter bought a billboard to slam ABC News over what he perceives as unfair and excessive coverage of the Russia investigation.

Kyle Courtney, from Boerne, Texas, wrote to ABC News that it has lost his long-time loyalty over its coverage of the 2016 presidential election.

“ABC News: I grew up with you. We are through. The Russians didn’t elect Donald Trump. I did," reads the billboard.
