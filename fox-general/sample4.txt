President Donald Trump said Thursday on Twitter that he did not make and doesn't have any recordings of his private conversations with fired FBI Director James Comey.

In a tweet last month, Trump said Comey should "hope" no such tapes existed, prompting Comey to then leak memos about the conversations to the media.

Now, some Democrats are claiming that Trump's tweets donâ€™t constitute an official response from the White House, and they're calling for further investigation into Trump's possible intimidation of a witness.

On "Special Report" tonight, Charles Krauthammer said this goes to show how "desperate" Democrats are becoming.
