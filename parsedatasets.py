    "Britain s fire-safety crisis expanded substantially Saturday as authorities said 34 high-rise apartment blocks across the country had cladding that failed fire safety tests. London officials scrambled to evacuate four public housing towers after experts found them  not safe for people to sleep in overnight.  Hundreds of residents hastily packed their bags and sought emergency shelter, with many angry and confused about the chaotic situation. Some refused to leave their high-rise apartments. Scores of evacuees slept on inflatable beds in a gym while officials sought better accommodations for them. Camden Council leader Georgia Gould said it decided to evacuate four blocks in north London s Chalcots Estate late Friday after fire inspectors uncovered problems with  gas insulation and door stops,  which, combined with the presence of flammable cladding encasing the buildings, meant residents had to leave immediately. The evacuation comes amid widening worries about the safety of high-rise apartment blocks across the country following the inferno that engulfed Grenfell Tower in west London on June 14, killing at least 79 people. Attention has focused on the 24-story tower s external cladding material, which has been blamed for the rapid spread of that blaze, but multiple other fire risks have now been identified in some housing blocks.

REUTERS/Hannah McKay - RTS18EWW The government said Saturday that the cladding samples that failed fire safety tests came from 34 apartment towers in cities including London, Manchester, Plymouth and Portsmouth. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said further testing  is running around the clock.  So far, Camden Council has been the only local authority to have asked residents to leave as a precaution. It said about 650 apartments were evacuated, though initial reports put the figure at 800 apartments. The council said residents would be out of their homes for three to four weeks while it completes fire-safety upgrades.  I know some residents are angry and upset, but I want to be very clear that Camden Council acted to protect them,  Gould said in a statement.  Grenfell changed everything, and when told our blocks were unsafe to remain in, we acted.

REUTERS/Hannah McKay - RTS18EWC Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, who has been criticized for her slow response to the Grenfell tragedy, said Saturday that the government was supporting Camden officials to ensure residents have somewhere to stay while building work is done. In response, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said May needed to  get a grip  and lead a stronger response to what is now a  national threat.  Residents   including families with babies and elderly relatives   trooped out of the buildings late Friday night with suitcases and plastic bags stuffed with clothes. Council workers guided dozens to a nearby gym, where they spent the night on inflatable mattresses. Others were being put up in hotels or other housing projects. Many residents complained about a lack of information and confusion. Officials first announced the evacuation of one building, then expanded it to five before reducing it to four. Some residents said they learned about the evacuation from the television news hours before officials came knocking on doors. Renee Williams, 90, who has lived in Taplow Tower since 1968, told Britain s Press Association:  No official came and told us what s going on. I saw it on the TV, so I packed an overnight bag.  It s unbelievable. I understand that it s for our safety but they can t just ask us to evacuate with such short notice. There s no organization and it s chaos,  she said. Carl McDowell, 31, said he took one look at the inflatable beds at the gym and went back to his Taplow apartment to sleep there overnight. Other residents were distraught that they were ordered to evacuate, but were told to leave their pets behind in buildings that could be dangerous. Fire-safety experts say the Grenfell Tower blaze, which police said was touched off by a fire at a refrigerator, was probably due to a string of failures, not just the cladding, which is widely used to provide insulation and enhance the appearance of buildings. Police said Friday they are considering filing manslaughter charges in the Grenfell disaster and they were conducting a wide-ranging investigation that will look at everything that contributed to it. The Metropolitan Police said cladding attached to Grenfell during a recent renovation failed safety tests conducted by investigators.

The government also urged building owners, public and private, to submit samples of their cladding. One hotel chain, Premier Inn, has calling in experts to check its buildings.

    "The number of refugees who entered the U.S. during President Trump s first three months compared to the last months of President Obama s term was cut nearly in half, according to statistics released Friday by the Department of Homeland Security. According to the statistics, a total of 13,000 refugees were admitted to the U.S. in the past three months, compared to 25,000 under Obama, The Los Angeles Times reported. The most popular countries of origins remained the same: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Myanmar. Obama set the ceiling of 110,000 refugee arrivals across the U.S. President Trump cut that number to 50,000 this year. Congress has approved a budget for only 75,000 for this fiscal year. A U.S. State Department spokesman said the country is now resettling 900 refugee arrivals weekly, to remain within that budget. Trump was praised by many supporters and criticized by others. Erol Kekic, executive director of the Immigration and Refugee Program for Church World Service, said at the time,  This program simply can t be turned on and off like a faucet. Federal court rulings have blocked Trump's executive orders suspending arrivals from certain majority Muslim nations. But the lower U.S. admissions numbers have disrupted a finely tuned, federally funded process that begins with exhaustive 18-month security screenings abroad. Trump is moving to significantly reduce the number of refugees allowed to enter the United States, even as his bid to temporarily suspend admissions is stalled in the courts. The statistics show that the Obama administration made an effort to increase the number of refugees before Trump by 86 percent. There are more than 63 million refugees worldwide, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees."

    "Ad sales boost Time Warner profit Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76  to $1.13bn ( 600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier. The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2  to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL. Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8  of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8  on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL's existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding. Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27  to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27  from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4  to $42.09bn.  Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,  chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5 , and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins. TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann's purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake. ",
    "Dollar gains on Greenspan speech The dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise. And Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government's willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan's speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data.  I think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,  said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York.  He's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next. Worries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing's policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the  time is ripe  for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve's decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars."

# fake2 = "There is a place for contempt in our public discourse. We should have contempt for a regime in North Korea that brutalized a young American student named Otto Warmbier. We should have contempt for a regime in Syria that uses poison gas to massacre innocent men, women and children. We should have contempt for Islamic State terrorists who behead Americans, burn people alive in cages and systematically rape Yazidi girls. But we should not have contempt for each other. Yet, we do. Our politics today is descending into a bitter spiral of contempt. And we saw the consequences in the attempted assassination of Republican members of Congress on a baseball fieldin Alexandria, Va., last week. Back when Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) was shot in 2011, many on the left were quick to blame conservative political rhetoric   falsely it turned out. But the attack on Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and his colleagues was politically motivated. The assassin volunteered for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), called President Trump a  traitor  on social media and, according to witnesses, asked if the players were Republicans before opening fire. No one is responsible except the would-be assassin. But his actions should serve as a wake-up call that the demonization of our fellow Americans who disagree with us has gone too far. The culture of contempt permeating our politics has now had near-fatal consequences. We need to put on the brakes and learn how to distinguish once again between our opponents and our enemies. Case in point: A few weeks before the Alexandria shooting, Hillary Clinton gave a commencement speech at Wellesley College where she declared that Trump s budget is  an attack of unimaginable cruelty on the most vulnerable among us, the youngest, the oldest, the poorest  (emphasis added). No, it is not. Using nerve agent on the innocent is  an attack of unimaginable cruelty.  Putting a hapless college student into a coma is an  attack of unimaginable cruelty.  Reducing the growth of government spending is not. Think for a moment what Clinton was saying: It s not simply that Democrats and Republicans have an honest disagreement about how best to help the most vulnerable among us. In Clinton s telling, Republicans are waging war on the vulnerable. That is toxic. No doubt, Trump has contributed mightily to our descent into the culture of contempt. (For example, the media is not the  enemy of the American people,  Mr. President). But since Trump s election, the scope and scale of political contempt on the left have reached unprecedented heights. Just a few months ago, when President Barack Obama was in office, it would have been unimaginable for a comedian to proudly pose for a photo holding up the president s bloody, severed head. Worst of all, we are in the process of cementing these attitudes in the next generation. On college campuses, students are being taught that it is acceptable to treat with contempt those with different ideas. We saw this phenomenon on display when Charles Murray   a distinguished conservative scholar   was shouted down and assaulted at Middlebury College in a riot that sent a professor to the hospital. Not a single student suffered any real consequences. Similar incidents are taking place on campuses across the country. Young Americans are learning that people they disagree with are not to be listened to respectfully and debated; they are to be silenced and driven out of the public square. This is not to suggest that there is no role for righteous anger in political discourse. Conservatives felt anger about many of Obama s policies, and liberals have every right to be angry about Trump s policies they find objectionable. And they have every right to fight like hell to stop them. But it wasn t so long ago that, despite bitter differences over policies, Republicans and Democrats still found ways to work together. President Bill Clinton and Republicans in Congress worked together to pass NAFTA and welfare reform. George W. Bush and congressional Democrats cooperated to pass tax cuts and education reform. Today, that kind of cooperation is unimaginable. And the reason is simple: When anger transforms into contempt, permanent damage takes place. As American Enterprise Institute President Arthur C. Brooks points out, a marriage can recover from anger. But when couples become contemptuous of each other, they will almost certainly end up in divorce court. That is where our country is headed today. Liberals need to understand: When they show contempt for Trump, they are expressing contempt for the millions of Americans who voted for him   including millions who twice voted for Obama. These Americans felt that the establishments of both parties were ignoring them and wanted to send Washington a message. The response they are receiving could not be clearer: We have contempt for the man you elected, and we have contempt for all of you who put him into office. They will never forget it. We need to pull back from this spiral of contempt before it is too late. North Korea is our enemy. Our fellow Americans who disagree with us are not. It s time we learn the difference   before someone gets killed.".split('.')

# real1 = "Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says the looming retirement of RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson is as good a time as any to consider rejigging the governance of the force, including the outstanding recommendation to set up a civilian oversight body. The change in command is an opportunity to examine all dimensions of governance and structure. The new commissioner will have important challenges to address in terms of maintaining the tradition and heritage of the force and at the same time acknowledging all of the new things that modern day policing requires,  Goodale said in an interview with Chris Hall, host of CBC Radio's The House. Obviously we've had issues internally to deal with, with the allegations of harassment and bullying, a major class action that the RCMP has now been successful in settling,  he said. The RCMP is just an absolutely fundamental institution in this country and the standards in terms of workplace behaviour has to be absolutely top of the heap. Former N.B. premier to head search for next RCMP commissioner Toxic culture, harassment issues overshadow commissioner's tenure Listen to CBC Radio's The House Goodale has already publicly acknowledged the support behind the idea of civilian oversight, which was the central recommendation of a 2007 report from a task force on governance and cultural change at the RCMP.  That's welcome news to Queen's University and Royal Military College professor Christian Leprecht, who is about to publish a study on the RCMP's leadership structure through the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. Security Bill 20170620 In the past, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has said the federal government should consider setting up a civilian board of management for the RCMP. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) Leprecht said you can't fix harassment and the RCMP's other issues if you don't fix the governance structure. Look to DND model? It's a fairly dysfunctional structure and organization but it is replete with very good people trying to do their best,  he said. Institutional cultural change is gradual but the only way you can get there is by changing the way the organization is managed and is governed. And if those aspects are fundamentally broken you're not able to [...] change or correct the kind of symptoms that we've all become familiar with in terms of harassment, abuse or some of the professionalization and leadership cultures that are currently coming out in the trial in Moncton. The RCMP has been on trial in Moncton, accused of failing to keep officers safe on June 4, 2014, when a gunman killed three Mounties and wounded two others.  Leprecht suggests a model that mirrors that of National Defence where there's both a chief of the defence staff and a deputy minister. RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson (centre) defence lawyers Ian Carter (left), Jeff Doody (right) RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson, centre, heads from the Moncton Law Courts with defence lawyers Ian Carter and Jeff Doody earlier this month during a break in testimony at the RCMP's Labour Code trial in connection with the June, 2014 shooting rampage that claimed the lives of three officers. (Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press) The challenge lies in really what we want the senior police officer, the commissioner, to focus on, [which] is operations, and leave all the policy pieces, the financial aspects, the HR issues to a professional civilian,  he said. Admittedly, said Leprecht, that's not an easy lift. [Goodale] is maybe the most experienced minister that not only the current government has but has ever held the public safety portfolio. So if there's one minister that actually has the competency, the experience, and the insights to do this, I think the current minister is that individual. Paulson's last day June 30 Paulson's tenure as Canada's top Mountie comes to an end June 30. His retirement will come after 39 years of service, including 32 in the RCMP. He has served as commissioner for more than five years. Commissioner Paulson has worked very hard at trying to build the momentum and the direction for modernization and improvement within the force,  said Goodale. The federal government has asked former New Brunswick premier Frank McKenna to head a selection committee of up to 10 people who will meet early this summer to begin the process of finding a replacement for Paulson. The group will be asked to present a short list of candidates from which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will choose Canada's next top cop. ".split('. ')
