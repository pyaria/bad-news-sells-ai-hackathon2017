Donald Trump's state visit to the UK is in fresh doubt after there was no mention of it in the Queen's Speech.
The US president accepted the Queen's invitation for him to travel to Britain when Prime Minister Theresa May visited Washington in January.
There have been reports that Mr Trump has changed his mind and does not want to visit while there is potential for protests against him.
But a Trump official told the BBC: "The two governments are discussing dates."
Number 10 said the Queen had not mentioned the visit because no date had been set.
Wednesday's Queen's Speech at the State Opening of Parliament saw the monarch announce the government's legislative programme for the next two years.
The Queen also uses the speech to set out her official plans for the year.
She said she looked forward to welcoming King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain for their state visit in July, and hosting the Commonwealth summit in April next year.
But there was no word about Mr Trump's state visit. October had been suggested as a possible date.

A Downing Street spokesman said: "An invitation has been extended and accepted.
"The visit wasn't mentioned in the Queen's Speech because a date hasn't been fixed yet."
In his last statement on the issue, White House spokesman Sean Spicer had said: "Her Majesty extended an invitation to the president. He's accepted that invitation. And we look forward to scheduling that trip.
"There is nothing that was scheduled and we look forward to working out a mutually acceptable date with the United Kingdom, and look forward to sharing that date."
